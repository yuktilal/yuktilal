 # Project Name
 Lending Club EDA case study
 Here we made some predictions and found about some intrsing patters which influence loan status as it is a target variable. We used features like loan amount,intrst rate,purpose
 annual income etc as they are indicators for the loan_status.We finally made some conclusions which could be a factor of people getting defaulted so we can make sure that these
 conditions should be taken care of when granting loan to customers.
 
## Table of Contents
We did analysis in four phases data understanding,data cleaning and preparation and then drawing  conclusions on analysis made.
Language used here was Python,Integrated Devlopment Editor used for Jupyter notebook for coding
 We depicted our conclusions in graphs using various plot like countplot,barplot etc
I would like to thank my partner 'Treza Jacob' for helping me in this case study and giving her thoughts to make it better.
